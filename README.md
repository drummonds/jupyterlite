# JupyterLite Demo

This is forked from jupyter lite for my own use.
So I have removed things I don't want while keeping the organisation the same.

I am adapting to my requirements.  My first attempt is to try out
using colour for building colour checker demos.  This is mean to complement
my blog at [the tartan dictionary](https://tartandictionary.org/posts/)
